### FaF Moderator Client
This repository contains a complete rewrite of the FaF Moderator Client in Kotlin using TornadoFX and Coroutines.

There is no intention for this to replace or be used as an alternative for the current moderator client. It is primarily in exercise for me to learn coroutines and practice writing an application to interface with the faf stack.
